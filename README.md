Writing my first program as part of practical activity within LSE - Data analytics course. 

You’ve been approached by a real estate company, Lindstrom & Thomas, to complete some basic data analysis on its sales for December. You’ve been provided with an incomplete table containing the property ID, the sales price, the commission, and the property price for the entire month.

Lindstrom & Thomas wants you to:

find the total sales for the month
calculate the average sales price for the month 
find the missing value from the last column of the table.
